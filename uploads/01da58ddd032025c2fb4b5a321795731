      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—It is my humble opinion, that no one will ever charge you with having “puffed” the Province of Hawke’s Bay. Perhaps, however, you uphold the good old rule, of cuffing scolding and flogging being every whit as needful for the young one as bread and milk?—That such treatment is the very best to bring him early to know himself, and to develop his young powers, and to assert his liberty, and to think and act independently? Perhaps so: at all events such will undoubtedly cause him to squall when so ill-hearted. Hence this cry of mine.— </p>
      <p>In your leading article of last Saturday’s <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, you say,— “We look anxiously forward to the future Government of the Province. It will commence 1861—so we are informed—some £6000 in debt”—and so on. But what are the <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>? Here they are:— </p>
      <p>On 1st November, 1860, Province was indebted to the Union Bank, £6307 11s. </p>
      <p>On 1st December, 1860, Province was indebted to the same, £4458 10s l0d. </p>
      <p>And, on 1st January, 1861, the debt was £4021 14s. 6d. </p>
      <p>Besides which, on the 31st December, 1860, the whole of the interest then due, amounting to £240 18s. 10d. was paid; otherwise the debt on 1st January would have to be less than £3800. </p>
      <p>And at this present time there are recorded applications in the hands of the C. L. Commissioner, made within the last three months, for upwards of 30,000 acres of land, the sale of which will come off early in March. </p>
      <p>                       Yours, &amp;c.,</p>
      <p>                               WILLIAM COLENSO.</p>
      <p> Napier,       January 16, 1861.</p>
