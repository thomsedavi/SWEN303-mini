      <p>No. 11.—<hi rend="smallcaps">Shadows</hi>. </p>
      <p>Do we really exist? Is there such a thing as matter? Is there an islet off Cape Kidnapper and a shingly beach at Ahuriri? Is there snow on the Ruahine Range and mud in Carlyle Street? Is all we see and taste and feel real? Are we to shut our eyes and believe all we hear? or open them, and be guided by our reason and our senses? There have been men—very wise men—who have both believed in and attempted to prove the non-existence of matter: there have been also others who have argued for the eternity of matter. One of the grand doctrines of the Hindoos is, that all we see is <hi rend="italic">brahm</hi>, or illusion; and we have no need to go out of Ahuriri to find those who (when “a little elevated”) have more than once believed a post to be a man. Some religionists make a virtue of disbelieving their own senses: and many in all ages have confused the unreal with the real, the shadow with the substance; hence has arisen the numerous (and apparently well-attested) stories of spectres ghosts goblins and fairies; hence too is derived a large proportion of the humbug and sham that is in the world. It is to be hoped, that the highly civilised part (at least) of the human race is getting better, through the rapidly advancing light of Science and the proper use of Reason, but, after all, when the many obstacles and the carelessness and wilfuiness of man are duly considered, it must be confessed very slowly. Persons who will not use their reason—who will not discriminate between the shadow and the substance—are like those foolish skaters on the Serpentine, who, in spite of the “<hi rend="smallcaps">Danger</hi>” boards of the Royal Humane Society, go carelessly on until they find the ice breaking around, and cold death embracing them. Then, again, there is another class, who may well be termed, <hi rend="italic">one-idea men </hi>(some of whom have from time to time “bored” us in the “open column” of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>; ) such see little or no difference in the glorious stars over their heads—or in Arrow-root and Potatoe starch—or in sunlight and moonshine; and, of course, to them an essay on shadows must be ‘as clear as mud,’ and therefore entitled to a most superlative sniff. To be sure, persons are not to be flouted for their want of intellect, but for their non-using it. And I verily believe that very much more is to be set down to carelessness and laziness on their part, than to niggardliness on the part of Dame Nature. </p>
      <p>I, myself, am but a plain man of common observation; simple enough, however, to believe my senses. It is my opinion, that the real things are those very things I see and feel and know by my senses. Now that a thing should really be perceived by my senses and at the same time not exist, is to me a plain contradiction. And when I so speak I do not mean by <hi rend="italic">my</hi> senses in particular but by those of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> others who choose to use their reason and to examine into things. All knowledge is of service; and a very useful knowledge is to be derived from a proper study of <hi rend="italic">shadows.</hi> I allude not to that artistic distribution of shade in paintings and mezzotints known as <hi rend="italic">chiaro-obscuro</hi>; nor to that more severely rigid delineation of shadow so necessary to true perspective: neither do I mean those celebrated aerial shadows of world-wide fame, long known as the Spectre of the Brocken—the Fata Morgana in the straits of Messina—the Mihrage of the African deserts—and the Castles in the clouds of the Polar circle.—But to the <hi rend="italic">Shadows</hi> which are to be met with in our every-day walk through life. As a general rule, it may be said, that, the more difficult toget at the substance or mass which throws the shadow the more available the shadow itself should be. The height of an inaccessible mountain, or of a steeple, may be known by its shadow; so also may the longitude of any place by the immersion of one of Jupiter’s satellites in the shadow of that planet. </p>
      <p>I shall not stop to consider whether the real pith of my subject is more of a physical or of a metaphysical nature,—of the mere animal, or of the more highly refined intellectual soul. For the present I have enough at hand in the sad aberrations around me. The principle is pretty nearly the same—whether seen in the Fantail-fly-catcher hopping from twig to twig and displaying his open tail, or in the swelling Turkey strutting in the sunbeams;—whether in the highly refined <hi rend="italic">belle</hi>, with her balloon-like skirt of crinoline her rouge and ostrich fealhers, or in her smirking savage Hottentot sister, with her cowrie and brass bracelets and the reeking entrails of a newly slaughtered bullock, wound round her person;—whether in the 4-year old urchin just breeched, or in the 40-year old one who chucklingly fancies himself 4½ inches higher from his having just obtained the addition to his name of <hi rend="smallcaps">esq., j.p</hi>., or <hi rend="smallcaps">a.s.s</hi>.—the principle, I say, is pretty much the same in every case; each creature fancying himself to be really bigger and of vastly more importance than he really is, so that all such greatness, being quite accidental unsubstantial and unreal, belongs only to dream-land and justly comes under the denomination of Shadows. </p>
      <p>Just bring a man well into the very focus of public opinion (and there is nothing in all the world to be compared to that)—let his accidents (whether <hi rend="italic">Esq., J.P., L.C, Sh-ff.,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ASS</hi>, it matters not,) be puffed aside; his public antecedents retrocedents and precedents be fairly viewed—and lo! it is as if you had a mite or an animalcule under the microscope; he is turned inside out, he is altogether denuded of his cloak of shadows, and he either improves or not, as the case may be, under the piercing scrutiny of the Public eye. </p>
      <p>But how few really improve! or, rather, how very few come up to what they were supposed to be! and why is this? Because men will insist on looking at the shadow instead of the substance—at the coat instead of the man. Just strip that would-be gentleman of his gold chain, and ring, and purse, and his swagger soon subsides, and it is soon patent to all that he never could have been a gentleman.—Just take from a man the spending of the Public Money, and the power and influence he had thereby is gone; let him lose all hopes of a good feed at the public expense, or of the post on which he has set his heart, and his patriotism rapidly evaporates.—Just let a man who has been carrying smartly on and apparently well to do in the world, but all on the credit of others, let such an one be stripped of his shadow and he will prove a man of straw.—Just try a great chatterer on any subject which demands deep insight and a well connected flow of thought, and ’tis like digging for water on Barrack Hill. But I might go on thus with common every-day examples until I had easily filled a whole sheet. </p>
      <p>I have heard mention of a great number of persons as candidates for the honor of Provincial Councillors. Be it so; the arena of the Council Room will surely prove them—surely strip some of them of their plumes stilts and bustlers. It may be at the outset some will think themselves to be fully as large as their own early-morning shadows; but <hi rend="italic">there</hi> (or I am much deceived,) they will be as if they were on the equator at noon. </p>
      <p>I do not see why we have not a Board of Examiners appointed to try all political aspirants. This might be done before or after Election. In the present day, in addition to those of the highest professions, examinations are constantly being made of candidates for very many offices—even down to that of a country village Schoolmaster;—and is the body of the State of less consequence? Perhaps a generation to come will see the need of this.—</p>
      <p>—Had some Board of this kind been established at Wellington (at the beginning of Responsible Government,) what an immense benefit it would have proved! What a means of prosperity to the place and Province! What a saving of time and money and reputation! What a preserver of every good and kind and manly feeling! What a touchstone and detector of shams and shadows! For, believing as I do, that man is as naturally a Creature of Order as he is of Society, and that being a Creature of Order he is also one of Law (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> of Law natural and suitable); it follows, that while all good laws are promptly and entirely submitted to, all bad ones are as naturally opposed, and are sure some time or other to be repealed. Now those bad or unsuitable laws—(<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> at home, the Game Laws, the Church Rates, and all those affecting liberty of conscience; here, the so-called ‘Algerine’ Act, the impossible Thistle, the unique Cur, and the unfair Fencing Acts,)—now all those laws are owing to selfishness, or to narrow-mindedness, or to incapacity on the part of the lawmakers. Our own Provincial <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> and unsuitable laws have cost us (in sheer making) some hundreds of pounds; and ’tis not too much to say that they never would have disgraced our name and Statute book, had we had real men and not shams and shadows in the Wellington Provincial Council.—</p>
      <p>Then again there are <hi rend="italic">Shadows</hi> of another class—which, possibly, some of our would-be Councillors will find <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> disagreeably close to their heels;—Shadows, black blue brown and grey, broad long and tightly fitting, umbras and penumbras, a host! These are of the kind the dog saw in crossing the stream on a plank with a piece of meat in his mouth. Imagine a man leaving the healthy every-day bustle of his Sheep or his Farm or his Store, to put on a suit of black and sit quietly and orderly and without his cutty pipe for 6 or 8 hours daily, giving close and undivided attention to dry statistical matters;—such an one, if a <hi rend="italic">shadow</hi>, will ere long be trying Holloway’s Pills, to be shortly followed by a wish for a whittling knife and stick (after the American fashion,) and before half the first Session is over will have huge and ugly thoughts that he has thrown up the real for the unreal, the substance for the shade.—Imagine another, who, in addition to the foregoing, has left a snug home and wife and family; ere long such an one will do more than dream of <hi rend="italic">dulce dulce domum</hi>.—Imagine a third, who, besides his uneasiness from inactivity, hears continually from his home, that his presence is necessary to his well-doing; such an one will assuredly be haunted by a horrible shadowy nightmare.—Imagine a fourth (if you can) who, in the height of dog-day elective zeal has thrown up his official situation (£200 a year it may be) to serve his country; ere long, if a shadow, he will begin to think he has paid too dear for his whistle!—Imagine yet a fifth, who, from having dreamed he saw some shadowy representation of a throne, became discontented with his honourable and useful situation, and thenceforth wriggled and strove and promised and smiled, and gained both a requisition and a seat in the Council;—</p>
      <p>—– ‘Such a nature,     <lb/>Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow     <lb/>Which he treads on at noon.’—</p>
      <p>— When lo! his eyes too are opened; he is now as a fish out of water, for he finds that he is out of his place, and that in stretching after the shadow he has lost the substance!! Now all this great grief and vexation of spirit comes upon the children of men through their contemplating their shadows instead of their realities, and so venturing to seek </p>
      <p>—– ‘The bubble reputation      <lb/>Even in the cannon’s mouth.’</p>
      <p>Let no one say I have shaded too darkly my sombre subject of shadows. Wait: time will shew. One of our most eminent English poets has sung much more gloomily of one of our chiefest and choicest human affections:— </p>
      <p>‘And what is friendship but a name,    <lb/>A charm that lulls to sleep;       <lb/>A shade which follows wealth and fame,     <lb/>And leaves the wretch to weep.’—</p>
      <p>And a greater than he, hath gone much further, saying,— </p>
      <p>— ‘Life’s but a walking <hi rend="italic">shadow</hi>, a poor player,  <lb/>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,     <lb/>And then is heard no more.’</p>
