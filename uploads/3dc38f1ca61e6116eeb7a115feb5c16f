      <p>No. 10.—<hi rend="smallcaps">All Alive, all alive ho!</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Walk up ladies and gentlemen, walk up! The most wonderful collection of birdsisses and beastisses iver seen.—Here’s the Chameleon wot changes his coat seven times a day; and here’s the beardless Monkey wot measures 41 inches from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail, and only 39 inches from the end of his tail to the tip of his nose!—Walk up, walk up, <hi rend="italic">feeding time close at hand</hi>. </p>
      <p>—Who among us has not rejoiced in his boyish days on hearing of the vans of wild beasts coming to his native town? Who, when a boy, has not run wild with joy in beholding the docile Elephant the handsome Panther and the majestic Lion? Verily Natural History—whether in sixpenny or in 5-guinea volumes—whether in the assemblage of living creatures in the Zoological. Gardens, or in the solitary white mouse, dancing bear, dressed-up monkey, or dumb tortoise of the Italian hurdy-gurdy grinder—Natural History, from the time of Father Adam down to our own day, has ever heen a fascinating science; one which has never failed to draw out the hearty yearnings of the human soul both old and young. </p>
      <p>Anciently ’twas said.— ‘Africa is the fertile home of monsters:’ modern times have been astonished at the very peculiar animals of Australia and New Zealand. Of those of Australia I shall not now say anything: of some of these of N. Zealand, (of our adopted home,) I shall hazard a few remarks. </p>
      <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Class</hi> 1. MAMMALIA. (<hi rend="italic">Beasts</hi>.) </p>
      <p>This great division of the Animal Kingdom is but poorly represented in N. Zealand; we have but one or two terrestrial families belonging to the 3rd <hi rend="italic">order</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnaria</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">(or Bats,)—</hi>one of which (<hi rend="italic">Vespertilio tuberculatus</hi>, Forster,) I shall briefly notice. The N. Zealand <hi rend="italic">Bats</hi> are rather rare and only to be seen flying at twilight. For years there had been a long and warm controversy, as to the Bat being bird or beast; and without doubt it partakes of both. Hence it is a good natural type of a two-faced person, of a <hi rend="italic">changeling</hi> in politics, of the turncoat or rat: one whom self-interest or the loaves and fishes have charmed. Such an one never works really well, not even with the party who bought him over; hence he (Bat-like) always hovers in the twilight, between the day and night, and having caught a few foolish flying Moths (as stray sops,) he hies away to his ‘cave in the earth’ to digest his meal at his leisure. </p>
      <p>Of the 9th order, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> (whales,) we have several genera; one of which is a species of the celebrated Dolphin (<hi rend="italic">Delpinus Zealandiæ</hi>, Quoy.) Ancient writers have written largely on the love of this creature for man—of his coming to shore on being called to be fed—his delighting in music an odours—and his carrying men on his back, through the sea. We, moderns, however, have not noticed these qualities. It is probable enough that our N.Z. <hi rend="italic">Dolphin</hi> (like many other beasts) would not object to be fed at the expense of others, and would not reject music and sweet scents; but as to his carrying men safely on his back through the seas—tell that to the Marines! Being also a voracious creature, he is a good natural type of a<hi rend="italic"> place-hunter</hi>,—one who wants an easy billet—one who promises roundly and fairly, smiling all over his countenance. But be timely warned; don’t trust him: at all events, get not on his back, (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> make him not a Provincial Councillor,) for assuredly you will find him a slippery customer, and in a stormy sea you are not likely to have the luck of old Arion. </p>
      <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Class</hi> 2.—AVES (<hi rend="italic">Birds</hi>). </p>
      <p>Of this world-admired class we have very interesting specimens; of the glossy-plumed <hi rend="italic">Alcedo</hi> family we have a species of the well-known Kingfisher (<hi rend="italic">Halcyon vagans</hi>), called by the Maories, <hi rend="italic">Kotaretare</hi>. The ancients said, that there was invariably never any stormy weather during the time this bird was making its nest, laying or sitting: hence, that period (about the winter solstice) was called ‘the halcyon days,’—when the seas were calm and navigable. Now <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Kingfishers are very small and shy and dull plumaged; and though of late our times have been not a little stormy, so that halcyon days (or, in other words, <hi rend="italic">peaceful and prosperous</hi> ones) would be highly acceptable, I fear we shall see but a small amount of them unless we get <hi rend="italic">that</hi> real good tried and well-fledged Kingfisher from Nelson, of which we have heard so much, through whom and his experience in <hi rend="italic">nest-building</hi> we might reasonably hope to see halcyon days.</p>
      <p>Then there is the Wood-hen; (<hi rend="italic">Ocydromus</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">Australis</hi>, Strickland;) or, Weka of the Maories—a bird belonging to the Rail family. This, bird is worthy of notice, if it were only on account of the New Zealand proverb respecting it— ‘<hi rend="italic">E hoki rua ranei te weka ki te mahanga</hi>?’ (Will the Woodhen return twice to the snare?) During the last two years this proverb has often been thought on by me, and it seems as if we were fast nearing the time when we should particularly remember it, and the effective moral it teaches; and so avoid choosing men as Provincial Councillors and Superintendent who would quickly take us back to a much worse snare than that from which we have but lately been delivered. </p>
      <p>But of all our New Zealand birds the Kiwi (<hi rend="italic">Apteryx Australis</hi>, Shaw,) is the most curious. This bird, as is well known, is without real wings, and its hairy feathers little resemble those of other birds. For a long time the existence of a wingless bird was doubted; it almost seemed a contradiction in terms. Nature, however, always balances her works: not so man. A bird, with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> wing or <hi rend="italic">one</hi> leg, or a beast with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> eye or three legs, would indeed be unnatural,—but not a bird without wings, or an animal without eyes—such are now known to exist. Just so it has seemed to me (when considering a late decision made by a high legal authority—and its probable consequences—respecting a Superintendent spending the public money unapplied and uncontrolled by the Provincial Council,) that the mere stripping away the ‘Peacock’s feathers’ from a Superintendent, leaving him to squander as he pleases the public cash, is equally as unnatural, under Responsible Government, as that of a bird with one wing or a beast with one eye. Either two wings or none: let us have no unnatural flutterings. Let the fact then of the <hi rend="italic">Kiwi</hi>, coupled with the present state of a neighbouring province (not to mention the secret aspirations of a few among us), be to us a powerful natural example, warning us as to whom we choose for our Superintendent. </p>
      <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Class</hi> 4.—PISCES (<hi rend="italic">Fishes</hi>.) </p>
      <p>Just one real fish I give you in this collection,.—and that is a species of the famed Remora (<hi rend="italic">Echeneis lineata</hi>, Menzies). This very curious fish, though small, was believed by the Ancients to possess the power of staying the largest ship under sail, by merely sticking to it, which it does by an organ composed of transverse plates situate on the top of its head. Remarkable and well-known instances of its ability are fully related by Pliny in his Natural History. While, however, we know nothing of its power to stay a ship, it is still used to catch fish and turtle by the Indians on the coast of Mozambique. A live one is made fast by a ring to a cord, and is then let go into the sea, when he soon adheres to a fish or turtle, and both are hauled up together into the canoe. Now we should also learn a useful political lesson from the little <hi rend="italic">Remora</hi>: let us just put an unfit man into the Superintendent’s office, and we shall soon find that our ship won’t sail—that we have got a Remora sticking to her keel, or (in other words,) we are in a <hi rend="italic">fix</hi>! </p>
      <p>Choose then, Electors, true and honest men for your Provincial Councillors; and so shew that you have not conned in vain a lesson of New Zealand Natural History. As far as I at present see, I know of no better plan by which to avoid many of the evils I have touched on in this Tract, than by our endeavouring to secure the well-known, tried and experienced Alfred Domett as our Superintendent. </p>
